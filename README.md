# FM TRANSMITTER WORKSHOP

Huge media companies increasingly control radio stations across the US. Take back the airwaves by building a low-power FM transmitter! In this workshop, students learn to solder a portable, battery-powered transmitter capable of broadcasting music, interviews, field recordings, or whatever weird sounds you want to send into the world. We'll talk about how FM radio works, Part 15 compliance, and the basics of soldering, then we'll assemble transmitters together and test them out in a collaborative transmission jam.
